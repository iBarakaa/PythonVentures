#in python you cannot use Reserved Words as variable names / identifiers
#the operations may look mathematical but they arent instead, they are computational
#the larger the program(sequence of steps to be done in order), the more useful the use of 'scripts'
#there are sequential steps, conditional steps (involvement of paths), and repeated steps (until an exit condition is met)
